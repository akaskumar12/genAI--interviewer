# 🧠 GenAI Virtual Interviewer (LLM-based)

This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful Proof-of-Concept (PoC) of a **Virtual Interviewer** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT-4. Given a dataset of resumes in a `.csv` format, the system extracts content and automatically generates intelligent interview questions for each candidate.

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Reads resumes from a CSV file
- 🧠 Uses OpenAI GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5-turbo) to generate custom questions
- 🔁 Interactive question-answer loop
- 🧪 Simple scoring of user responses based on keywords
- 🛠️ Clean modular code with easy customization

## 🧾 Resume Dataset Format

Ensure your `resumes.csv` file looks like this:

| name       | resume_text                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| John Doe   | Experienced software engineer...     |
| Jane Smith | Data scientist with 3+ years...      |

- **name**: Candidate name *(optional but helpful for display)*
- **resume_text**: Clean text extracted from resume files
